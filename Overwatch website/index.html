                        We can not be certain, probably never. Overwatch 2 was announced at Blizzcon in 2019, about 
                        two and a half years ago.

                        Why?
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        Truth be told, we don't know. The minds at Blizzard cannot be comprehended by mere normal human beings.
                        their track record in trashing promising series is impeccable. See -> Starcraft 2, WoW, Heroes of the Storm, etc.
